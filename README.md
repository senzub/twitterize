# Twitterize

Twitterize is an app that allows users to organize their twitter favorites into categories. People often use favorites as a way to bookmark and save a tweet, which get lost in time due to the continous deluge of information on social media.

Twitterize is my solution to this problem by organizing favorites into easily accesible categories. This was my most challenging project to date and helped me learn the basics of reactjs and database storage using mongodb.
